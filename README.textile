Demo project for a basic attempt to build simple Scala projects using rake,
by someone with very little Scala experience!

h2. Tasks:

<pre>
rake clean    # Remove any temporary products.
rake clobber  # Remove any generated file.
rake default  # Run specs and build jar file
rake run      # Run application from jar file
rake spec     # Run specs
</pre>

h2. Assumptions

* Source is in src
* Specs are in spec/src
* If you want to use _rake run_, then the _PROJECT object is an application
* <code>scalatest-1.0.jar</code> exists in <pre>$JAVA_HOME/lib</pre>
